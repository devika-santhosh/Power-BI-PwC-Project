# Power-BI-PwC-Project
The Power BI Virtual Case Experience, in collaboration with PwC, offers a platform to tackle genuine business situations utilizing Power BI. This experience is composed of three case studies, namely:

-   Call Centre Trends (Depicting customer and agent patterns)
-   Customer Retention (Insights into customer demographics)
-   Diversity & Inclusion (Examining gender distribution in the executive suite)

# Call Centre Trends (Depicting customer and agent patterns)
The call center trends are the subject of this case study. Here, we examine various call metrics such as the quantity of incoming calls, calls answered overall, calls answered quickly, average call duration, and overall satisfaction rating. We can filter agents according to the requirement in order to monitor their performance.Finding the areas where performance can be watched over and improved is the aim.

# Customer Retention (Insights into customer demographics)
The company is interested in identifying potential clients who may leave. This dashboard is being used to analyze:

  - Each user has signed up for specific services, such as phone, internet, online security, etc.
  - Details on the customer account, such as the contract, monthly fees, and mode of payment.
  - Customer characteristics such as partner, dependents, and gender.

# Diversity & Inclusion (Examining gender distribution in the executive suite)

Here, we build a dashboard to examine the organization's gender balance. We could see the overall number of employees as well as the number of employees by gender. 

We could examine the number of female hires by department, gender-specific promotions, performance ratings, and hiring patterns. For a balanced workforce and business success, it is essential to promote diversity and eradicate gender-based stereotypes.
